## Introduction

The PKS Ninja Community aspires to host courses and educational assets for all level of learners from beginner to expert

At the time of writing, the learning assets available do require some general knowlege of information technology, systems administration, Linux, and some familiarity with devops concepts. Participants should also be familiar with VMware vSphere. Significant expertise or deep knowledge in any specific subject is not required

Participants can confirm needed background knowledge prior to beginning courses or lab exercises on this site by completing VMware Hands On Lab [HOL-1931-01-CNA - VMware Enterprise PKS - Getting Started](https://labs.hol.vmware.com/HOL/catalogs/catalog/874)

If you get started with HOL-1931 and struggle or would like to get more detailed explanation of foundational concepts, thorough entry level tutorial videos are available on the [VMware Cloud Native Channel on Youtube]() 

Also, the [VMware Hands on Labs]() provides numerous additional guided online lab exercises that cover a wide range of complimentary topics including introductory vSphere, Linux, Containers and many more

If you can understand and complete HOL-1931, you should have sufficient skills to proceed using educational materials on this site. While you will benefit from additional depth in many subjects, most of the lab guides on the site provide very detailed instructions to help new learners get through the exercises successfully and gain exposure and familiarity with new technologies as you proceed through the materials

## Recommended Learning Resources

VMware Cloud Native products use many leading open source technologies and standard open languages, tools and practices

There are volumes of educational materials available from educational institutions and freely on the internet for related technologies like Linux, Containers, Microservices, DevOps, Kubernetes and many other related technologies. Participants may learn these skills anywhere and apply their knowledge and experience directly to VMware Cloud Native platforms 

For example, VMware PKS and Cloud PKS implement standard upstream open source Kubernetes with a standard API and standard Kubectl client. Kubernetes clusters provisioned by PKS are built on Ubuntu Linux and utilize the Docker container engine. Accordingly, students who learn about these technologies from any source can apply their knowledge to VMware products, and likewise students who learn about these technologies from a VMware affiliated course can utilize their skills on any implementation of the technology

While there are far too many excellent learning resources to list them all here, a few key learning resources are provided below for your reference:
