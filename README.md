## Community Intro & Overview

The PKS Ninja Labs on Github Community is dedicated to building a community of students and practitioners of Cloud Native Technologies. The community seeks to provide practical educational experiences that help enrich and maximize the knowledge sharing potential for community participants and contributors.

The PKS Ninja Labs Github Community originally started to host lab guides for the VMware internal PKS Ninjs SME program for select VMware SE's. This site hosts the lab guides used in the private [PKS Ninja SE course](https://github.com/CNA-Tech/PKS-Ninja/tree/master/Courses/PksNinjaSe-NI6310), and also adds a wealth of additional content that is updated on an ongoing basis. 

Practical, hands on experience and regular practice is key to becoming an effective practitioner in cloud native technologies. The Ninja learning model focuses on hands on eductation, centered around real world workflows, tools and processes, and made real through actual contribution in open & open source community projects

While the community does have an overall focus on VMware PKS, all are welcome as learning materials on this site cross a broad range of related topics with a strong focus on open source, devops, and all things cloud native
