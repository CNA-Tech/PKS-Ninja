## Contributor Introduction

Contributing back to the pks-ninja community is a core part of the learning experience for participants. The PKS-Ninja repo uses the same contribution processes and workflows as major open source projects and in modern devops environments, offering students the capacity to learn in a real, but safe and supportive environment

Most of the participants in the community are here for their own learning benefit and don't have much time to contribute, and that is great! The main ask for contributors is if you use any learning materials on the site and you see any problems or have any recommendations, let us know by opening a git issue or making a direct update to the site. Some participants may want to get deeply involved while others may just be passing through, the community benefits from all types of participation!

Whether you are an experienced git veteran or a first time committer, contributing can be easy to get started, and instructions are provided to make it comfortable and straght forward process for first time committers. In fact one of the challenges many people have learning git is that even introductory courses often try to teach a lot of different things about git that you don't need to know to make use the most common features

The instructions provided do not require you to know a lot about git, you will learn exactly the steps you need to be productive, these will become very familiar to you and you will become comfortable with most common standard uses of git. As you learn and grow towards more advanced uses of git with time, you will already be comfortable and familiar with the basic use and benefits of the system and learning the more advanced topics will be much easier

So if you are new to git or contributing to community projects, there may be some steps that may seem unfamiliar at first, but it is a powerful skill and getting started now will help you accelerate your path to becoming comfortable and productive with devops and cloud native technologies

You do not need to be a programmer to commit and add meaningful value to github projects. Every community needs people to maintain informational pages, documentation, tutorials, wikis, and lots of scripts and engineering files that are every bit as valuable as application code. Even fixing a minor typo uses the same exact process as updating code, adds value to the community and builds up your github profile and portfolio!

## Contributor Quickstart

- Step 1: Go through the steps in the [Community Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/CNA-Tech/PKS-Ninja/tree/Pks1.4/Courses/GettingStarted-GS3861) including setting up your student folder. These steps will help you become familiar with the environment, and you will need to complete these steps to be able to make appropriate contributions
- Step 2: Review the [Contributor Guidelines](), all material submitted to the PKS-Ninja repo must comply with these guidelines and are subject to the licensing and conditions provided
- Step 3: Review the [Contributors Introduction]()
- Step 4: Go through the [Setting up your Contributor Repository]()(https://github.com/CNA-Tech/PKS-Ninja/tree/Pks1.4/LabGuides/ContributorWorkspace-CW4267) lab guide. It is important to note that while most of the setup is a one-time process, contributors need to follow the simple steps provided in the lab guide to sync your repo every time you want to make any commitments going forward
- Step 5: Review the questions listed in the [Contributors FAQ](), additional details are available for most common questions and new topics will be added reqularly. Reach out to the email or slack channel if you have a question that is not answered here, and please add new entries to the FAQ list if you have feel it would benefit others
- Step 6: Remember, even after setting up your repository, you need to sync your fork every time you want to make any updates. If you start to make updates to your local copy of a file without syncing, it can add a lot of complexity to the process and your updates are more likely to be rejected
- Step 7: Always keep your commits small and frequent, as detailed in the [Setting up your Contributor Repository]() lab guide. This is an active community and other people may notice and attempt to add similar updates at the same time as you which can cause merging conflicts. If you commit and PR your updates frequently, conflicts are far less likely to happen, and if you ever do have a conflict if you commit is small then it minimizes wasted time and overlapping efforts.
- Step 8: Take some courses and do some labs! A key goal of the community is that every participant learns and benefits from the materials. As you go through the materials, take note of the formatting and style, observe what you do and don't like and share any observations or recommendations you have. If you have any problems or see anything that can be improved, open a git issue or use the PR process to update the material directly. 

Thank you for your participation and contribution!!!

### What can I add to an existing course or lab guide

- While some material on the site may be open for any reasonable community update, many courses and guides have a very specific purpose and intent. In the future, every course and lab guide should have contributor guidelines posted in the course/labguide readme or other clearly labeled file in the course/labguide subdirectory
- If you see any typos, obvious errors or incorrect technical steps, in nearly all cases updates are appreciated keeping in mind that for minor updates, you should try to make your updates in line with the style and formatting used in the resource you are updating
- Use your judgement to determine if you feel your suggested update fits well with the scope and intent of the resource you are updating, and if it is a good fit, chances are the merge will be accepted. If for any reason the content owner does not agree with your recommended update, you can always make a seperate course or lab guide, while we recommend minimizing redundant content, if you feel the changes you are recommending are important for your learning, chances are there are others who will benefit as well. Different students come from different backgrounds and learn differently, and it is good to provide more resources to help support more different participants in the community
- If you are not sure if updates you would recommend would be a good fit for the resource you would like to update, feel free to reach out to the content owner. At the time of writing, content ownership is not listed for most resources, however we are working on making this update. Currently if you do not see any owner listed for a resource you would like to discuss, reach out to the email and/or slack lists for additional support
- If your update is not accepted for any resource, please keep in mind you can add seperate courses and lab guides, and when seeking to add significant updates to an existing lab guide, it can be a good practice to add it to a seperate file in the /Staging directory where you can create a file with your updates as an example/mockup to show an example
