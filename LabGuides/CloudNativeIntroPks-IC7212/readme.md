</details>
<br/>

1.1.11 From the Main Console (ControlCenter) desktop, open a new tab in the chrome browser and connect to `https://github.com/nginxinc/docker-nginx/blob/master/mainline/alpine-perl/Dockerfile/` to observe a sample dockerfile maintained by the nginx community to build a complete nginx image from the ground up, starting with a minimal alpine container, and then installing only the dependencies and default configurations required to run an nginx server. As you saw earlier in step 1.1.2, you were able to deploy this entire configuration by running the `docker run nginx` command with a few configuration flags. The ability to download a pre-configured image is similar to downloading an ova file, except containerized formats are generally simpler, smaller and faster.

### 1.2 Create a custom Docker Image

1.2.1 In this step you will create a dockerfile which you will build to create a new nginx container named `custom-nginx` that includes the configuration you created for the `my-nginx` container in the previous steps

Make the `~/custom-nginx` directory and use the nano text editor to create the `~/custom-nginx/dockerfile` file with the following commands:

```bash
mkdir ~/custom-nginx
cd ~/custom-nginx
nano dockerfile
```

In the nano text editor, enter or copy and paste the following text:

```text
FROM nginx

RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y curl
RUN echo 'to be or not to be, that is the question' >> /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
```

Press the `ctrl + o` keys and hit the `Enter` key to save the file, and then press `ctrl + x` keys to exit nano

<img src="Images/2019-03-02-01-55-23.png">
</details>
<br/>

1.2.3 From the `cli-vm` prompt, enter the command `docker build . -t custom-nginx-image` to build an image using the dockerfile you created in the previous step, using the `-t` flag to tag the image with the name `custom-nginx-image`. 

Observe that in the output, the docker build process will go through each of the commands in the dockerfile you created in the previous step, as shown in the following screenshot

1.2.4 From the `cli-vm` prompt, enter the command `docker images` and observe that you can see the `custom-nginx-image` you just created

<details><summary>Screenshot 1.2.4</summary>
<img src="Images/2019-03-02-01-29-42.png">
</details>
<br/>

1.2.5 From the `cli-vm` prompt, enter the command `docker run -p 8080:80 --name=custom-nginx -d custom-nginx-image` to start a new container named `custom-nginx` based on the `custom-nginx-image` you created in the previous steps, and enter the command `docker ps` to confirm the container is running

<details><summary>Screenshot 1.2.5</summary>
<img src="Images/2019-03-02-01-58-16.png">
</details>
<br/>

1.2.6 From the `cli-vm` prompt, verify that your new image includes the curl utility, and that your nginx server is serving your modified index.html page with the following commands:

```bash
docker exec -it custom-nginx /bin/bash
curl http://localhost
```

As the output validates, the `custom-nginx-image` container image includes the curl utility and custom nginx configuration you specified in the dockerfile you created

<details><summary>Screenshot 1.2.6</summary>
<img src="Images/2019-03-02-02-03-11.png">

### 1.3 Distributing your images with docker hub

1.3.1 From the Main Console (ControlCenter) desktop, open a new tab in the chrome browser and connect to `https://hub.docker.com/` and login. If you do not have a docker hub account, create one now.

Once you are logged into docker hub, click the `Create Repository +` link, and create a new repository with the following values:

- Name: `custom-nginx-image`
- Visibility: `Public`
- click `Create` to create the repository

<details><summary>Screenshot 1.3.1.1</summary>

</details>
<br/>

1.3.2 Resume your putty session with `cli-vm`, from the prompt, add a tag to your `custom-nginx-image` to prepare it for upload, and then push your image to the new repository you created on docker hub with the following commands:

**Note: Be sure to replace the string `YourDockerhubUsername` in the command below with your docker hub username**

```bash
docker tag custom-nginx-image YourDockerhubUsername/custom-nginx-image:v1
docker login #follow the prompts to log into your docker account
docker push afewell/custom-nginx-image:v1
```

<details><summary>Screenshot 1.3.2</summary>
<img src="Images/2019-03-02-03-15-48.png">
</details>
<br/>

1.3.3 From the Main Console (ControlCenter) desktop, resume your chrome browser connection `https://hub.docker.com/`, return to your `custom-nginx-image` repository page, and observe that the image you uploaded with the `v1` tag is now available in the repository. As this is a public repo, you can now use this repository to distribute your custom image to any docker client with access to docker hub.

<details><summary>Screenshot 1.3.3</summary>
<img src="Images/2019-03-02-03-22-16.png">
</details>
<br/>

1.3.4 Delete the local copies of your `custom-nginx-image` with the following commands:

**Note: Be sure to replace the string `YourDockerhubUsername` in the command below with your docker hub username**

```bash
docker images
docker rmi -f YourDockerhubUsername/custom-nginx-image:v1
docker rmi -f custom-nginx-image
docker images
docker rm custom-nginx
docker ps -a
```

<img src="Images/2019-03-02-03-37-45.png">
</details>
<br/>

1.3.5 Enter the command `docker run -p 8080:80 --name=custom-nginx -d YourDockerhubUsername/custom-nginx-image:v1` which will first check to see if your custom image is in your local docker cache, and since it is not will search the default search location (docker hub), pull the image to the local image cache, and run a container from the image.

**Note: Be sure to replace the string `YourDockerhubUsername` in the `docker run` command with your docker hub username**

<details><summary>Screenshot 1.3.5</summary>
<img src="Images/2019-03-02-03-41-15.png">
</details>
<br/>

1.3.6 Confirm that your `custom-nginx-image` that you pulled from docker hub is working as expected, and clean up your environment with the following commands:

**Note: Be sure to replace the string `YourDockerhubUsername` in the command below with your docker hub username**

```bash
docker ps
docker exec -it custom-nginx /bin/bash
curl http://localhost
exit
docker stop custom-nginx
```
